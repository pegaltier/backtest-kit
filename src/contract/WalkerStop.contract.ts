/**
 * Contract for walker stop signal events.
 *
 * Emitted when Walker.stop() is called to interrupt a running walker.
 * Contains metadata about which walker and strategy should be stopped.
 *
 * Supports multiple walkers running on the same symbol simultaneously
 * by including walkerName for filtering.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { walkerStopSubject } from "backtest-kit";
 *
 * walkerStopSubject
 *   .filter((event) => event.symbol === "BTCUSDT")
 *   .connect((event) => {
 *     console.log("Walker stopped:", event.walkerName);
 *     console.log("Strategy:", event.strategyName);
 *   });
 * ```
