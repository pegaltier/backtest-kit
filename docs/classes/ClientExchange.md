# ClientExchange

Implements `IExchange`

Client implementation for exchange data access.

Features:
- Historical candle fetching (backwards from execution context)
- Future candle fetching (forwards for backtest)
- VWAP calculation from last 5 1m candles
- Price/quantity formatting for exchange

All methods use prototype functions for memory efficiency.

## Constructor

```ts
constructor(params: IExchangeParams);
```

## Properties

### params

```ts
params: IExchangeParams
```

## Methods

### getCandles

```ts
getCandles(symbol: string, interval: CandleInterval, limit: number): Promise<ICandleData[]>;
```

Fetches historical candles backwards from execution context time.

Algorithm:
1. Align when down to interval boundary (e.g., 00:17 -&gt; 00:15 for 15m)
2. Calculate since = alignedWhen - limit * step
3. Fetch candles starting from since
4. Validate first candle timestamp matches since (adapter must return inclusive data)
5. Slice to limit

### getNextCandles

```ts
getNextCandles(symbol: string, interval: CandleInterval, limit: number): Promise<ICandleData[]>;
```

Fetches future candles forwards from execution context time.
Used in backtest mode to get candles for signal duration.

Algorithm:
1. Align when down to interval boundary (e.g., 00:17 -&gt; 00:15 for 15m)
2. since = alignedWhen (start from aligned when)
3. Fetch candles starting from since
4. Validate first candle timestamp matches since (adapter must return inclusive data)
5. Slice to limit

### getAveragePrice

```ts
getAveragePrice(symbol: string): Promise<number>;
```

Calculates VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) from last N 1m candles.
The number of candles is configurable via GLOBAL_CONFIG.CC_AVG_PRICE_CANDLES_COUNT.

Formula:
- Typical Price = (high + low + close) / 3
- VWAP = sum(typical_price * volume) / sum(volume)

If volume is zero, returns simple average of close prices.

### formatQuantity

```ts
formatQuantity(symbol: string, quantity: number): Promise<string>;
```

Formats quantity according to exchange-specific rules for the given symbol.
Applies proper decimal precision and rounding based on symbol's lot size filters.

### formatPrice

```ts
formatPrice(symbol: string, price: number): Promise<string>;
```

Formats price according to exchange-specific rules for the given symbol.
Applies proper decimal precision and rounding based on symbol's price filters.

### getRawCandles

```ts
getRawCandles(symbol: string, interval: CandleInterval, limit?: number, sDate?: number, eDate?: number): Promise<ICandleData[]>;
```

Fetches raw candles with flexible date/limit parameters.

Algorithm:
1. Align all timestamps down to interval boundary
2. Fetch candles starting from aligned since
3. Validate first candle timestamp matches aligned since (adapter must return inclusive data)
4. Slice to limit

All modes respect execution context and prevent look-ahead bias.

Parameter combinations:
1. sDate + eDate + limit: fetches with explicit parameters, validates eDate &lt;= when
2. sDate + eDate: calculates limit from date range, validates eDate &lt;= when
3. eDate + limit: calculates sDate backward, validates eDate &lt;= when
4. sDate + limit: fetches forward, validates calculated endTimestamp <= when
5. Only limit: uses execution.context.when as reference (backward)

Edge cases:
- If calculated limit is 0 or negative: throws error
- If sDate &gt;= eDate: throws error
- If eDate &gt; when: throws error to prevent look-ahead bias

### getOrderBook

```ts
getOrderBook(symbol: string, depth?: number): Promise<IOrderBookData>;
```

Fetches order book for a trading pair.

Calculates time range based on execution context time (when) and
CC_ORDER_BOOK_TIME_OFFSET_MINUTES, then delegates to the exchange
schema implementation which may use or ignore the time range.
