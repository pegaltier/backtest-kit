```ts
declare function listenStrategyCommitOnce(filterFn: (event: StrategyCommitContract) => boolean, fn: (event: StrategyCommitContract) => void): () => void;
```

and automatically unsubscribes. Useful for waiting for specific strategy actions.

## Parameters

|-----------|-------------|
| `filterFn` | Predicate to filter which events trigger the callback |
| `fn` | Callback function to handle the filtered event (called only once) |
